##What is this
This is a TypeScript browser implementation of Battleships. Play a single player game where the objective is to sink all of the ships on the board! Specification by Guestline [https://medium.com/guestline-labs/hints-for-our-interview-process-and-code-test-ae647325f400]
##How to use this
This repo includes the compiled javascript in addition to the source typescript code. To build the project first navigate to the root directory in `bash` or command prompt, then install the required dependencies using the command `npm install`. 
After this is done you can then run the command `tsc` to compile the source TypeScript file into JavaScript which will be used by the UI.
